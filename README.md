# üñºÔ∏è Neural Style Transfer App

This is a deep learning-based application that performs neural style transfer ‚Äî combining the content of one image with the artistic style of another to generate a new stylized image. The project uses a pretrained VGG19 model and is built using PyTorch and Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## About the App

The application allows users to:

* Upload a **content image** (the structure/image you want to preserve).
* Upload a **style image** (the artistic style you want to apply).
* Adjust key hyperparameters such as **content weight**, **style weight**, and **total variation loss weight**.
* Choose the **optimizer** to be used during the stylization process (Adam or L-BFGS).
* Visualize the **real-time progress** of the stylization process directly in the browser.
* View and download the final stylized image once the process completes.

## How It Works

1. The content and style images are first resized and normalized.
2. Features are extracted from a pretrained VGG19 model.
3. A new image is initialized (from content, style, or random noise).
4. Using gradient-based optimization, the pixels of this image are iteratively updated to minimize:

   * **Content loss** (difference between content features of generated and content images).
   * **Style loss** (difference between Gram matrices of style features).
   * **Total variation loss** (encourages spatial smoothness).
5. The result is a new image that captures the content of the first image and the texture/style of the second.

## Features

* **Interactive Streamlit Interface**: Upload images, tune parameters, and track progress in real time.
* **Optimizer Support**: Choose between Adam and L-BFGS based on speed or quality preference.
* **Real-Time Visualization**: View the stylized output evolving across iterations.
* **Robust Error Handling**: Handles edge cases like invalid inputs or unstable loss values.
* **Downloadable Output**: Final image is available to preview and download directly from the UI.

## Future Enhancements

* Add support for **style transfer with color preservation**.
* Include multiple style blending.
* Enable image style transfer on mobile with a lightweight backend.
* Integrate GPU acceleration on cloud for faster processing.
